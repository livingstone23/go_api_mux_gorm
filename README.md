# REST API with Go using Gorilla/Mux and GORM

This repository contains a RESTful API built with Go (Golang) that leverages the `gorilla/mux` package for routing and `GORM` ORM for database interactions. The API provides full CRUD functionality and is backed by a MySQL database.

## Features

- **Routing**: Implemented using `gorilla/mux`, a powerful URL router and dispatcher for Golang.
- **ORM**: Uses `GORM`, a fantastic ORM library for Golang, to interact with the MySQL database seamlessly.
- **Database**: MySQL is used as the database engine, ensuring robust and efficient data storage and retrieval.
- **CRUD Operations**: Supports full Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for managing resources.

## Technologies Used

- **Go (Golang)**: The main programming language for the API.
- **Gorilla/Mux**: For routing and handling HTTP requests.
- **GORM**: For Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) to interact with the MySQL database.
- **MySQL**: The database engine used to store application data.
